// struct are ALWAYS copied
// struct NEVER use ARC (like init and deinit)

//whereas classes passed by reference
//same as class def

//BUT class have more functionnalities :
// - Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another
// - Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime
// - Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned
// - Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance
